Elm: An Object-Relational Mapping Library
=========================================

Welcome to Elm's documentation. Elm is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library written in C#. It's free, open-source and works with .NET 4.5 and ASP.NET Core. Elm supports MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and SQLite. It supports the Fluent syntax. Honestly, it's pretty awesome.
